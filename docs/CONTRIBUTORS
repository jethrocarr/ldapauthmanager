CONTRIBTION INFORMATION
=======================

(If you are looking for information on who has developed or contributed
changes to this program, please see the AUTHORS file.)


If you would like to contribute changes to this program - whether it is code,
documentation or alternate language support, please send it to either the project
development mailing list or directly to developers@amberdms.com.

Security issues should always be reported to security@amberdms.com so that
we can issue updates promptly to all users.

Amberdms will always public credit anyone who finds a security flaw or contributes
any other content.


The following are requirements for getting your code (or any other content) merged upstream:


1. Amberdms requires copyright assignment of your code, otherwise we can not use it. We
   require assignment so that we can license the source code under different licences
   in future or for commercial reasons (eg: dual licenses).

   You still retain full credit for developing the code.

   To do this, when sending your code, please add the following:

  "I assign copyright ownership of this source code to Amberdms Ltd (New Zealand) to
   use in anyway they see fit."


2. Amberdms can not accept any code which is covered by software patents - if you wish to
   submit patented technologies, Amberdms will only accept if all of the following are true:
   	
	a) You/your organisation owns the patent(s) in question.

	b) You issue a world-wide, irrevokable, royalty-free license for anyone using Amberdms
	   source code under an open source license (as defined by the OSI or FSF).

	c) The patented code must be clearly marked.



Please send all submissions to any of the following locations:

a) The development mailing list for the project:

b) security@amberdms.com (security issues only)

c) developers@amberdms.com (private submission to Amberdms)
